# GenAI Data Analytics Assistant

A lightweight, Python-based assistant that uses a local Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze CSV files via natural language questions. Built for students and educators exploring how to integrate Generative AI with data analysis workflows.

---

## Features

- Load a CSV file
- Ask natural language questions
- Generates and executes relevant `pandas` code
- Returns structured answers + natural language explanations
- Runs fully locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and [LLaMA3](https://ollama.com/library/llama3)

---

## How It Works

1. The user loads a CSV file.
2. The assistant sends a prompt to the LLM describing the table structure.
3. The LLM generates Python `pandas` code to answer the question.
4. The code is executed locally using `eval()`.
5. The output is summarized in plain English using a second LLM prompt.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (installed and running locally)
- A supported local LLM (e.g., LLaMA3)

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the local LLM (LLaMA3):

```bash
ollama run llama3
```

---

## Run the code

```bash
python ollama_agent.py
```

You will be prompted to enter:

- A CSV file path (e.g., `sample.csv`)
- A natural language question

**Example:**

```
Enter path to your CSV file (e.g., sample.csv): sample.csv
Ask a question about the data:
> Which product has the highest revenue?
```

The program will:

1. Send a preview of the data and your question to the LLM
2. Get back a `pandas` command like:  
   ```python
   df.groupby("Product")["Revenue"].mean().idxmax()
   ```
3. Execute the command
4. Send the result back to the LLM for a human-friendly summary
